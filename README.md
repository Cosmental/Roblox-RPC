# FAQ ‚ùî

**Q: I have a bug report! Where can I report this?**
> A: Feel free to post bug reports [here!](https://github.com/Cosmental/Roblox-RPC/issues/new)

**Q: What tools were used in the process of making this application?**
> A: I mainly used [batch files](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/batch-file#:~:text=A%20batch%20file%20is%20a,a%20sequence%20in%20the%20system.)
to create most of the application. These are essentially command prompt commands with a more automated structure. As for the **.exe** files, I used [Bat To EXE converter](https://bat-to-exe-converter-x64.en.softonic.com/)
to set up the file!

**Q: Where can I get this for Linux and/or Mac-OS?**
> A: Those plateforms are currently unsupported. I don't really plan on adding support for those systems anyways due to this being an experimental project and not a 
full blown "professional" application. Sorry!

# Author Notes üìù
This application is NOT professional by any means, nor is it claimed to be a "fully" functional application. I am aware
of it's various flaws, but I do not entirely plan on fixing them often/as soon as possible. I made this application PURELY
for research purposes, I am not familiar with the workflow of "exe" applications and this is my first ever software
application.

I would appreciate feedback or constructive critism though!
